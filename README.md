# ABCU Course Advising Program

This repository contains the final code submission for SNHU CS-300.

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The course was focused on analyzing runtime and memory complexity of common data structures and algorithms in order to guide us on creating efficient implementations when designing code in the future.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
This is a difficult question to answer. I approached the problem in a way that would keep runtime complexity to a minimum while also maintaining a level of ease-of-use within the codebase. There are very efficient solutions possible sometimes that sacrifice maintainability and the ability for outside developers to modify the code in the future.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There were no roadblocks. Everything was fairly straightforward. If there had been, I would have overcome them by breaking the problem into its smaller component parts.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It hasn't really except maybe I'm slightly more inclined to actively(<-keyword) to analyze the runtime efficiency of something I write.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This wasn't really the focus of the course and I believe that, in-general, course material at SNHU doesn't do a good job at this.
